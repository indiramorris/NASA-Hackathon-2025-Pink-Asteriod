# NASA Hackathon 2025 - Pink Asteriod Project
## Project description
The Pink Asteriod Project is a beginner friendly, interactive exploration os asteriod impacts, designed to be both educational and fun.
The project consists of two main components: an animation that visually demonstrates a pink asteriod falling and impacting, and mini game where users can interact with the asteriod, 
observe effects, and learn key concepts.

The project emphasizes accessibility and engagement by using a colorful pink and purple theme that is visually appealing and colorblind-friendly.
Educational pop-ups provide short explanations of asteroids, impact effects, and related scientific concepts in a simple and understanable way. 
Storytelling elements guide users through the scenario, making the experience immersive and enjoyable.

This project also includes regional considerations, simulating impact effects in hurricane prone areas such as The Bahamas, giving a relatable context to the asteriod simulations. 
The mini game component allows users to experiment with asteriod size and speed, observing different outcomes and reinforcing the educational material through interaction.

Standout features include:
-Mini game interaction to engage users
-Storytelling elements to guide users through the scenario
-Educational pop ups explaining asteriod science and impact effects
-Accessibility focused color scheme and visual design 
-Regional simulation elements for real world context

Overall, this project transforms raw coding and visualization into playful, educational experience for beginners, students,
and anyone interested in learnig about asteriod impacts in an interactive way.
